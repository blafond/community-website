        %h4 Teiid is a data virtualization system that allows applications to use data from multiple, heterogenous data stores.
        %br
        %h5 Teiid is comprised of tools, components and services for creating and executing bi-directional data services.  Through abstraction and federation, data is accessed and integrated in real-time across distributed data sources without copying or otherwise moving data from its system of record.
