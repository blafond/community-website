%h2 Why Teiid?
.clear
  %br/
%strong 1. Familiar Interface: JDBC
%p
  %span.product Teiid
  has a very familiar interface: JDBC!  Every Java developer is familiar with JDBC access to data sources.  Now leverage your knowledge of the JDBC  standard to access
  %em all
  your data sources.
%ul.icons-ul
  %li
    %i.icon-li.icon-ok-sign
    JDBC 4.0 API
  %li
    %i.icon-li.icon-ok-sign
    DML SQL-92 support (with select SQL-99 and later features)
  %li
    %i.icon-li.icon-ok-sign
    Support for standard JDBC scalar functions
.clear
  %br/
%strong 2. Familiar Query Language: SQL
%p
  Want to query non-SQL sources in the same way you do with SQL sources? With Teiid, you can! You can access data from any types of sources, and interact with those sources using
  %u a single flavor of SQL
  \- even if the native sources do not understand SQL!
%ul.icons-ul
  %li
    %i.icon-li.icon-ok-sign
    DML SQL-92 support (with select SQL-99 and later features)
  %li
    %i.icon-li.icon-ok-sign
    Issue SQL to any data source -- see  currently supported sources
  %li
    %i.icon-li.icon-ok-sign
    Level the data access playing field, using one version of SQL dialect, scalar functions, and datatypes

  %br/
%strong 3. Multiple Sources Look Like One
%p
  With Teiid, you can join and union data that resides in very dissimilar data sources. Multiple sources suddenly look like a
  %em single
  source to your application.
%ul.icons-ul
  %li
    %i.icon-li.icon-ok-sign
    Joins across data sources
  %li
    %i.icon-li.icon-ok-sign

%strong 4. Easy To Deploy
%p
  The
  %span.product Teiid query engine
  is a Java component - it plugs right    into your application, like any other Java library. Deployment is simple.
%ul.icons-ul
  %li
    %i.icon-li.icon-ok-sign
    Embed in plain old Java app
  %li
    %i.icon-li.icon-ok-sign
    Deploy to app servers
  %li
    %i.icon-li.icon-ok-sign
    Available as a stand-alone server in

%strong 5. Eliminate Hand-coded Data Access Logic
%p Real applications often access more than one data source.  We know that. Teiid technology from MetaMatrix has been in the business of enterprise data integration     since 1999.  Many of you have built your own frameworks to handle integrating     multiple sources, and have realized the difficulty of doing that in a generic     manner that performs and scales well under real use conditions.       Now you can retire your custom frameworks and hand-coded logic, and use a      dedicated query component for all your data access needs.  This lets you focus      on the logic on top of the data access layer rather than the nuts and bolts of      accessing heterogeneous data uniformly.
%ul.icons-ul
  %li
    %i.icon-li.icon-ok-sign
    %i Cheaper
    \- than hand-coding and maintaining hand-coded integration, and re-inventing integration logic on every project
  %li
    %i.icon-li.icon-ok-sign
    %i Better
    \- than non-optimized integration logic that does not make use of a real query engine
  %li
    %i.icon-li.icon-ok-sign
    %i Faster
    \- to implement your projects, leveraging the integration logic already built into Teiid, and reusing that logic on other projects

%strong 6. Battle Tested - and Improving
%p
  You don't want to be a guinea pig for someone's "product" experiments. Don't worry - with Teiid, you won't have to. Teiid is a component form of the query engine that is the heart of the JBoss Enterprise Data Services Platform (JBEDSP), which is used by large commercial organizations, independent software vendors, and many federal agencies, including intelligence agencies responsible for protecting citizens in the U.S. and other countries. These are organizations that cannot and do not play with toys, so you can have confidence that our products have been put through the ringer a number of times.

  Still not convinced?  What if we told you that all this was merely the tip of the iceberg?     That's right - there's more!       Not only can you do more with the Teiid query engine, but everything you do can be leveraged and extended with the Teiid Server and
  %span.product JBoss Enterprise
  Data Services Platform.
