## Teiid is a data virtualization system that allows applications to use data from multiple, heterogeneous data stores.
Teiid is comprised of tools, components and services for creating and executing bi-directional data access services.

Find documentation about legacy Teiid and Teiid Designer projects for your on-premise use-cases here:

**Teiid**: http://teiid.jboss.org

**Teiid Designer**: http://teiiddesigner.jboss.org

Through abstraction and federation, data is accessed and integrated in real-time across distributed data sources without copying or otherwise moving data from its system of record.
